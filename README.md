Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains code for a movie recommendation system built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system provides movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie similarities.

Overview
The recommendation system utilizes two main approaches:

Collaborative Filtering: This technique recommends movies to users based on their past interactions (ratings). It employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in user-item interactions and predict ratings for unrated items.

Content-Based Filtering: This method recommends movies similar to a given movie based on their attributes, such as plot summaries. It calculates the similarity between movies using TF-IDF vectors of their plot summaries and recommends movies with high similarity scores.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and converting categorical variables into dummy variables.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains collaborative filtering model (SVD) using Surprise library and evaluates its performance using cross-validation. Also, computes content-based recommendations using cosine similarity.
Visualization: Provides visualizations of data distributions, genre distribution, and content-based recommendations.
Predictions: Predicts ratings for a given user and movie using the trained collaborative filtering model.
Dependencies
